I haven't master the markdown, so I use the readMe.txt temporarily to describe the project I participated in.

This is a License-Plate-Recognition-System(Written with Qt/C++).This project is based on the opencv and easyPR which is a chinese car license plate recognition system.

Based on client/server architecture,use bpnn to implement the recognition process(accuracy:0.74).
The Recognition-System in server includes 4 parts:
1. License plate extraction
2. License plate processing
3. Character segmentation
4. Character recognition
